Version: 0.0.12
Date: 2022.03.27
  Changes:
    - The Groundwater Pump now is able to pump normal Water instead of Clean Water. Ready for agriculture.

  Features:
    - Added the Notification System. The player can subscribe to buildings and get notified if important things happen there.
    - Notification System: Upbringing Stations can now inform the player if a class finishes.

  Factory-Breaking Changes:
    - Gave the Microalgae Farm pipe connections, enabling it to do its recipes. Seems like the connections got lost for some copy-paste-and-forget reason.
    - Gave the Fermentation Tank another set of pipe connections, which enables it to do the Pure Culture: Pemtenn recipe. I thought I already did this, but apparently that was in another universe.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.0.11
Date: 2022.03.23
  Bugfixes:
    - Fixed a crash related to the generic "active" field in GUIs not being initialised.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.0.10
Date: 2022.03.18
  Changes:
    - The speed malus of Groundwater Pumps is now set to the bigger one of competition_malus and maintenance_malus, rather than both maluses combined. This avoids having the pump stop entirely if you screw up in early game.
    - Reworked the way new citizens get their castes if an upbringing class finishes. Now the chance is rolled per student instead of once for the whole class.
    - Reworked the probabilities which caste a student will choose. Now the targeted caste's chance depends on its Effectivity technology and the counter-probability is split up evenly on the other castes. This avoids that the chance to get the targeted caste sinks with every additional unlocked caste.
    - I changed some recipes for buildings. It's a bit hard to summarize all changes, because I'm kinda generating recipes automatically if they use items that don't belong to Sosciencity. I tried to adress the cases where the generated recipes were weird (like greenhouses needing engines).

  Features:
    - Added a startup-option to exchange Wood for Lumber in the ingredients of all recipes that don't belong to Sosciencity. This allows to automate e.g. Small Electric Poles. The setting gets disabled automatically if there is another mod present that balances wood - at the moment pyanodons, IR2, Angel's Bio Processing and Krastorio 2. Please tell me if there are more.

Version: 0.0.9
Date: 2022.03.14
  Changes:
    - The Gunfire HQ Defense Turrets now have their base-graphic - because that looks nicer. Existing ones might look weird, because that changes their offset. So maybe mine and re-place them.
    - After popular complaint, the Orchid Plant Care Station now is cheaper.

  Bugfixes:
    - Fixed a freeze related to a broken loop in the water-consumption code.
    - Fixed that the Gunfire Bonus sometimes was off by a factor of 100.

  Factory-Breaking Changes:
    - Reduced the size of the Barrack. You might need to mine and replace the existing ones if that breaks your layout.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.0.8
Date: 2022.03.13
  Balancing:
    - Experimental: The output of annual plant recipes is now split into two entries. This may look confusing as it doesn't change the average output and output range. It changes the probability distribution so that very low or very high outcomes are less likely and average outcomes are more likely to occur.

  Bugfixes:
    - Fixed a crash related to an unsave 'pairs'-loop in the disease-update function.
    - The recipe for Ferrous Sulfate is now unlocked with the Ember Caste to avoid a technology deadlock.

  Features:
    - Added a range indicator for buildings before they are placed.
    - Added a range indicator for buildings with a global range.
    - The Gunfire HQ now has 4 defensive turrets. These are active if the building is staffed.
    - Hospitals can be allowed or disallowed to treat specific diseases.

  Minor Features:
    - Treating Gender Dysphoria now will actually change the gender of the inhabitant.

  Gui:
    - Added a Drinking Water catalogue to the water tower's gui.
    - Added a statistic of the treated diseases to the hospital's gui. These statistics were already recorded, just not displayed until now.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.0.7
Date: 2022.03.05
  Balancing:
    - Changed the Clockwork Caste Bonus again. The "insufficient maintenance"-malus will now reach -80% when the maintenance cost exceeds two times your available Clockwork points.
    - Increased the calorific demand of all castes by a factor of 8, because it was p'ss easy to feed thousands of them with just a few farms.
    - Reworked the internal 'size' parameters of most animals, which specifies the slaughter yields and husbandry recipes. This first step aims to overall betterfy the slaughter recipes. In a soonish patch I will rework the husbandry recipes, because I really don't like them.
    - Increased the maluses for wrong climate/humidity for most annual plants because they mattered little before.
    - Changed the growth rate of most annual plants to reduce the variance in efficiency. These are still a bit too efficient for my taste, but I would like to see this first step in action.
    - The Gathering, Hunting and Fishing Recipes were nerfed greatly by reducing their yield and increasing the time. You wouldn't believe how insanely effective they were before.

  Changes:
    - Removed the power usage of the water tower.
    - Changed the recipe of the microalgae farm, because it had a placeholder one before.
    - The aquafarm now also counts as an animal farm for inhabitant health malus reasons. No idea why it wasn't before.
    - Updated the graphics of the Big Living Container (formerly known as House 8) and the Small Prefabricated House.
    - Husbandry recipes now have the circle-icon like the farming recipes to make it easier to distinguish them from the slaughter recipes.
    - The Fishing recipes with Harpoon/Fish Net are now delayed to after chemical science.
    - Reduced the tofu's calorie amount because it had a weird intern 'portion_size' parameter. To counter this the recipe now returns 3 items.
    - Reduced the chickpea's calorie amount as it was a bit too high. Apparently I got the nutrients of dried chickpeas when I was researching that. :)
    - Changed the eggplant's nutrient values because they had the tomato ones for some copy-paste-and-forget reasons.
    - Changed the fish meat's nutrient values because they had the biter meat ones for some copy-paste-and-forget reasons.

  Features:
    - Added the medbay, an improvised hospital for the early game. Though it has a placeholder graphic for now.
    - Added a new house, the Barrack, which aims to be suitable for the Gunfire caste.
    - Added graphics to Gunfire HQ
    - Added graphics to Ember HQ. They might change again soon, but I'd like to use this patch to update the entity size.
    - Added graphics to Egg Collecting Station
    - Added the Simple Fishtrap as an early game fishing tool

  Factory-Breaking Changes:
    - Swapped the graphics of the spring-house and the summer-house, because I missunderstood my graphics department. This changes the height of both entities. You might need to mine and replace the existing ones.
    - The entity size of the Gunfire HQ, Ember HQ, Egg Collecting Station and the Big Living Container changed to accommodate their new graphics. You might need to mine and re-place the existing ones.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.0.6
Date: 2022.02.05
  Balancing:
    - It turned out I didn't like the intended way for the Clockwork Caste to work. So I reverted the last version's change.

  Changes:
    - The standard Gathering is now unlocked from the start of the game.

  Bugfixes:
    - Fixed a bug in my datastage-library that resulted in missing furniture recipes and a broken gathering recipe.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.0.5
Date: 2022.02.04
  Balancing:
    - The emigration speed of unhappy citizens now depends on their caste and is a lot slower in general

  Bugfixes:
    - The Clockwork Caste Bonus was not calculated as intended.

  Changes:
    - I tried to improve the visibility of the range highlighting by adding a border

  Features:
    - Added graphics to Orchid Plant Care Station
    - Added graphics to Waste Dump
    - Added graphics to Waste Incineration Plant
    - Added two new houses which are suitable for the Orchid caste
    - Setting to specify if agricultural plants pollute or clean pollution
    - The trash site's GUI states how many inhabitants live in its range and an estimate of the produced garbage
    - I tried to enhance the caste tooltips at the top of the screen. They should explain the mechanic of the caste's bonus.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Balancing:
    - Nerfed the food gain by Gathering, buffed the Phytofall blossom yield

  Bugfixes:
    - Disease deaths were reported in a wrong way
    - Entities like the fishing hut used a smaller range when looking for water than shown

  Changes:
    - Compostable items now state their humus yield in the item tooltip
    - Compound entities state their energy usage and workforce requirements in the tooltip

  Features:
    - Added graphics to composting silo
    - Added graphics to composting silo output
    - Added graphics to upbringing station
    - Removed graphics of egg collecting station
    - Instead the computing center now has the look of the egg collecting station. Fits more.
    - Tiriscef and Profanity warn you if inhabitants don't have enough food variety.
    - Tiriscef and Profanity warn you if an entity doesn't have enough workers.
