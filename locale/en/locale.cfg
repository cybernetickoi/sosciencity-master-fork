ember-caste=Historically the Ember Caste was a small group of people that stayed at the campfire and kept the fires alife.

foundry-caste=If you combine the Clockwork and the Gleam Caste, you essentially get the Foundry Caste. Engineers. They take scientific findings, some nights and a lot of caffeine - and create a machine that solves exactly your problem. (Also, they will increase your mining productivity.) 
orchid-caste=Officials that plan and organise the society. They strive to create beauty and make everyones live better. 
aurora-caste=A small group of really famous people. Actors, Artists, Mod Autors... - people that inspire other people. While they are technically members of the Ember Caste, they are often seen as their own group. They will increase the productivity of rocket silos.
