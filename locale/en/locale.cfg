[technology-description]
clockwork-caste=Undemanding, simple and living in boxes. The Clockwork Caste consists mostly of mechanics that keep factories and thus civilisations up and running. Also, they will speed up your machines.
ember-caste=Historically the Ember Caste was a small group of people that stayed at the campfire and kept the fires alife. In modern times they became the caste of all the people without a caste-forming profession (or due to growing automation: without any profession at all). They are the core of culture, art and social engagement. Everyone likes to have them around.
gunfire-caste=The Caste of the military. They do not talk much, but they will make your defenses deadlier.
gleam-caste=Curious and in pursuit of a better understanding of the world - like a spark in the dark. The Gleam People dedicate their lives to expanding their knowledge and sciences. Intellectuals, professors and livelong students that will increase the speed and productivity of your labs.
foundry-caste=If you combine the Clockwork and the Gleam Caste, you essentially get the Foundry Caste. Engineers. They take scientific findings, some nights and a lot of caffeine - and create a machine that solves exactly your problem. (Also, they will increase your mining productivity.) 
orchid-caste=Officials that plan and organise the society. They strive to create beauty and make everyones live better. 
aurora-caste=A small group of really famous people. Actors, Artists, Mod Autors... - people that inspire other people. While they are technically members of the Ember Caste, they are often seen as their own group. They will increase the productivity of rocket silos.
