[technology-description]
clockwork-caste=Undemanding, simple and living in boxes. The Clockwork Caste consists mostly of mechanics that keep factories and thus civilisations up and running. Also, they will speed up your machines.
orchid-caste=Masters of the flora. The Caste of the farmers, gardeners, botanists. They are also really good cooks.
gunfire-caste=The Caste of the military. They do not talk much, but they will make your defenses deadlier.
ember-caste=Historically the Ember Caste was a small group of people that stayed at the campfire and kept the fires alife. In modern times they became the caste of all the people without a caste-forming profession (or due to growing automation: without any profession at all). They are the core of culture, art and social engagement. Everyone likes to have them around.
foundry-caste=If you combine the Clockwork and the Gleam Caste, you essentially get the Foundry Caste. Engineers. They take scientific findings, some nights and a lot of caffeine - and create a machine that solves exactly your problem. (Also, they will increase your mining productivity.) 
gleam-caste=Curious and in pursuit of a better understanding of the world - like a spark in the dark. The Gleam People dedicate their lives to expanding their knowledge and sciences. Intellectuals, professors and livelong students that will increase the speed and productivity of your labs.
aurora-caste=A small group of really famous people. Actors, Artists, Autors, Mod Makers... - people that inspire other people. While they are technically members of the Ember Caste, they are often seen as their own group. They will increase the productivity of rocket silos.

sosciencity-start-clockwork-points=Free Clockwork Points you get at the start of the game. This allows you to build a factory that can support a city before the maintainance costs slow everything down. I recommend setting this to 0 if you play without maintainance costs.
sosciencity-entity-updates-per-cycle=The number of entities (like houses) that are updated per update cycle. An update cycle occurs every 10 ticks or 6 times per second. A low value will make the entities slow to react to changes, a high value will have a negative impact on performance.
