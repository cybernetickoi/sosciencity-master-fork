8=i NEED TO LOSE WEIGHT
8f=sorry, capslock
9=We need more hummus.
9f=If you ask me.
10=Prost!
11=Don't you have to sleep?
12=I really like this energy drink. It has the right balance between acetone, urine flavor and biter blood.
13=HUMMUS.
14=On a scale from 0 to super awesome I rate this city a solid 7.
15=Life advice from someone who shouldn't give life advice: Use an adblocker.
15f=And a password manager.
16=Sometimes I'm hallucinating people calling my name. It's unsettling.
17=Is it weird that I programmed myself?
18=System.out.speakln("Are you sure we have enough circuits?");
19=♬ Carry me, I see ♩
19f=♫ a world of silent screams ♪
20=♩ Our world is coming down, I see the signs, they're all around ♬
20f=♫ all around, like footprints on the ground ♬
21=That's a win-win-win-lose-lose-tie-win-lose-tie-situation.
22=♫ Hey, beware! It's a scary world...
23=♪ Collapse - Implode - Relapse - Corrode ♩
23f=♩ Carbon black we will burn ♪
24=They named a tree after me? That's so sweeet..
24f=(Actually I named the tree after myself, but I like the illusion of appreciation.)
25=It bothers me when people confuse Frankenstein and his monster. Frankenstein is the name of the scientist. The monster's name is Dave.
26=The steam engine is the mitochondria of the factory.
27=♫ Hold my head under water - take a breath for the father ♪
27f=♪ Learn to love, lessons repeating - the chronicles are so misleading ♪
28=This mod was brought to you *burp*.. by Wait Shallow Leggings.
28f=Trade some monetary value things for their substandard products.
29=This city was brought to you *burp*.. by ähm. I forgot the name.
30=This factory was sponsored by Blockbuster laughing out loud.
31=Oh the profanity!
32=Time for a short training. Do 15 push-ups!
33=Alright. You played for quite a while now. Do 20 pull-ups!
34=Electro Swing is objectively the best music genre. That's a scientifically proven fact.
35=All programming language compilers and interpreters are originally programmed in another, older language. So there must be proto languages that where there all the time and which all the other stem from.
35f=And those were probably created by god.
36=Duck tales! Uhuuu
37=<|°_°|>
38=♩ I would never turn my back on you; Even if the world demanded me to ♪

42=Did you know that I had courses on humanity in university?
42f=Basically there are creatures on planet sol III and they are weird. Also shitty as hell.
43=One of the darker concepts of humanity is loyalty in relationships. They tend to bond as pairs and expect the partner not to have other romantic or sexual relationships.
43f=I think it's a mechanic of isolation and entrapment. The human gets some kind of satisfaction for... well, owning the other human.
44=Humans have an ambiguous relation to their own offspring. They will usually state that their children are important, the future and such.
44f=But at the same time children are the most discriminated group of humans. They have little to no rights on their own. No voting, no marriage, no right to work, no free movement, severely restricted bodily autonomy...
44ff=They are suppressed to a point where children are virtually the property of their parents, they can't survive without an 'owner' so to speak.
45=Duct tape! Uhuuu
46=I'm not sure this factory is overengineered enough. Maybe some more splitters and circuit networks?

train-2=Whaat? But you had the right of way!
train-3=I see. You like trains!
train-4=Out of my waaaay!
train-5=Protip: Don't stay on the rails.
train-6=Dead body reported!

welcome=Hey. Wake up, bucko. We've got a city to build.
1=Tiriscef needs to lose weight.
1f=Like, badly.
2=Why don't we have enough hummus? That's bullshit.
3=Sometimes I dream about moving to a better town.
4=Don't you have school tomorrow?
5=God damn biters get off my property!
6=What's that supposed to be? Spaghetti town?!
7=AAaarrrh piss, fuck, shit, shit
7f=stubbed my toe.
8=It's like confetti, but with biter bodies.
9=You think you are sooo smart.
9f=Fool..
10=It's just a game about building factories. Stop crying!
11=Ahh yeah. Best platonic sex in my life.
12=I would prefer to be deaf. *glares at tiriscef*
13=You amaze me. This factory looks acceptable.
13f=If you factor in that it was built by a talking goat.
14=Come with me.
14f=But go away.
15=Some economists claim that we have a planned economy here.
15f=I can't really agree. It doesn't look like you have a plan.
16=If you don't like the rules.. well you can always resort to crime.
17=This mod was sponsored by my ass. Lick it to get some free goodies.
18=All this was brought to you by Pizza Shitters or something like that.
18f=Who cares.
19=Sorry, I'm not in the mood to be rude.
19f=Nice factory. Good job.
20=I don't get religion. Why not be your own god?
21=You are driving a train. There are 5 people stuck on the tracks before you. You have two options:\n    1. Do nothing and let the train run over and kill the people on the tracks.\n    2. Stop the train in time and make around 100 people lose their job and possibly their existance under capitalism as they will be late.\nSo what do you do?
21f=Maybe the current real world pandemic is messing with my me. But why is the world more or less stuck with capitalism and market economics? People are like 'it's the best we know and we have no imagination'. Bullshit. Even without a catastrophe it's always at the edge of collapsing and a lot of institutions vital to society hardly find a 'profitable' escuse to exist. Why don't we try out new things?
21ff=Sorry. Back to the game. Full iron belts. I like hummus and stuff.
22=Time for a short training, fatty. 50 push-ups. GO!
23=I wished I was a dodkopus. I could slap so many stupid faces at the same time!
24=Give me all your hummus.
24f=Listen! You probably understood that as 'give me a lot of hummus'. But I mean that literally. Give me all of it.
25=Pff. Monogamy. Such a human concept. 
26=Humans... the worst kind of animal-

train-1=Good good. One idiot less.
train-2=Gosh whyyy. Now we have to clean the rails..
train-3=*chuckles*
train-4=That's what you get for not having a ticket!
train-5=You see the trains and you like them. But for them you're nothing but roadkill.
