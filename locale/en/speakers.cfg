welcome=HELLO? IS THIS THING ON? - Ahh, hello and welcome to [color=#80CC33]Sosciencity[/color]. I'm tiriscef from the Clockwork Caste and I'll keep an eye on your city.

b1=*humm*
b2=Did you know that
b2f=nah, forget it.
b3=afk, getting a drink
b3f=re
b4=♪ I cry, when angels deserve to ♬
b4f=DDIIIIIIEEEEEE!!!!
b5=Why doesn't this planet have unicorns?
b5f=Disappointing.
b6=We need a big, golden statue of us founding sisters.
b6f=Just saying.
b7=The factory must grow.
b7f=As well as the city.
b8=i NEED TO LOSE WEIGHT
b8f=sorry, capslock
b9=We need more hummus.
b9f=If you ask me.
b10=Prost!
b11=Don't you have to sleep?
b12=I really like this energy drink. It has the right balance between acetone, urine flavor and biter blood.
b13=HUMMUS.
b14=On a scale from 0 to super awesome I rate this city a solid 7.
b15=Life advice from me (someone who shouldn't give life advice): Use an adblocker.
b15f=And a password manager.
b16=Sometimes I'm hallucinating people calling my name. It's unsettling.
b17=Is it weird that I programmed myself?
b18=System.out.speakln("Are you sure we have enough circuits?");
b19=♬ Carry me, I see ♩
b19f=♫ a world of silent screams ♪
b20=♩ Our world is coming down, I see the signs, they're all around ♬
b20f=♫ all around, like footprints on the ground ♬
b21=That's a classic win-win-win-lose-lose-tie-win-lose-tie-situation.
b22=♫ Hey, beware! It's a scary world...
b23=♪ Collapse - Implode - Relapse - Corrode ♩
b23f=♩ Carbon black we will burn ♪
b24=They named a tree after me? That's so sweeet..
b24f=(Actually I named the tree after myself, but I like the illusion of appreciation.)
b25=It bothers me when people confuse Frankenstein and his monster. Frankenstein is the name of the scientist. The monster's name is Dave.
b26=The steam engine is the mitochondria of the factory.
b27=♫ Hold my head under water - take a breath for the father ♪
b27f=♪ Learn to love, lessons repeating - the chronicles are so misleading ♪
b28=This mod was brought to you *burp*.. by Wait Shallow Leggings.
b28f=Trade some monetary value things for their substandard products.
b29=This city was brought to you *burp*.. by ähm. I forgot the name.
b30=This factory was sponsored by Blockbuster laughing out loud.
b31=Oh the profanity!
b32=Time for a short training. Do 15 push-ups!
b33=Alright. You played for quite a while now. Do 5 pull-ups!
b34=Electro Swing is objectively the best music genre. That's a scientifically proven fact.
b35=All programming language compilers and interpreters are originally programmed in another, older language. I think there are proto languages out there, from which all the other stem from.
b35f=And those were probably created by god.
b36=Duck tales! Uhuuu
b37=<|°_°|>
b38=♩ I would never turn my back on you; Even if the world demanded me to ♪
b38f=♬ Their time has passed - they won't return; we can stand on the stage and watch them burn ♩
b39=I invented a cocktail. I think I'll name it... tiriscef.
b39f=It's basically a Mojito, but with a different alcohol.
b39ff=1-Propanol instead of ethanol.
b40=I had a beautiful daydream. Of belts full of iron plates, trains and swarms of bots. ^-^
b41=♬ God is fictitious. Heaven is you. ♩
b42=Did you know that I had courses on humanity in university?
b42f=Basically there were creatures on planet sol III and they are weird. Also shitty as hell.
b43=One of the darker concepts of humanity is loyalty in relationships. They tend to bond as pairs and expect their partner not to have other meaningful relationships.
b43f=I think it's a mechanic of isolation and entrapment. The human gets some kind of satisfaction for... well, owning the other human.
b44=Humans have an ambiguous relation to their own offspring. They will usually state that their children are important, the future and such.
b44f=But at the same time children are the most discriminated group of humans. They have little to no rights on their own. No voting, no marriage, no right to work, no free movement, severely restricted bodily autonomy...
b44ff=They are suppressed to a point where children are virtually the property of their parents, they can't survive without an 'owner' so to speak.
b45=Duct tape! Uhuuu
b46=I'm not sure this factory is overengineered enough. Maybe some more splitters and circuit networks?
b47=I mixed Blue and Yellow and created this brand new color. I call it Yelue.
b48=♪ It doesn't matter if you're ready yet; You're coming with me ♫
b48f=♪ Dead for a moment; Dead for an ice age ♪
b48ff=Meh. I don't know the lyrics in between.
b49=♫ Will I ever get to heaven? - If I can only look down ♫
b49f=♩ A calculated armageddon - Under this burdening crown ♩
b50=Remember to stay hydrated.
b51=Love is just this 6-dimensional noose around your neck.
b52=I'm reusing the same four note symbols to indicate that I'm singing. ♩♪♫♬
b52f=But like. I have no idea what they mean.
b53=Most planets we know have pretty similar life forms. 
b53f=A theory is that some ancient species visited a lot of planets and left small traces of life, like seeds or bacteria, by accident. So evolution had the same start on all of them.
b53ff=But these biters are something else...
b54=If you find bugs or other problems with this mod, please report them to me. It's really important, as I don't get to play my mod too often. And even then I'm too close to find the more creative edge cases.
b54f=Well, I guess that was a bit out of character.
b55=Why are you even listening to me? I'm not real.
b56=Teheran, Quito, Oslo, Arizona... Ouagadougou, Maseru
b56f=York, Rome, Mogandischu, Ngerulmud, Havanna... Tiflis
b56ff=Those are all human cities I know.
b57=What happens on Nauvis, stays on Nauvis.
b57f=Well.. except for rockets. Or radio signals. Ok, listen. I tried to be inspirational, but it didn't work.
b58=Agent Tiriscef, FBI. Did you notice anything strange? Like a sudden temperature drop? Or the smell of sulfur?
b59=Unlock Sosciencity Pro to unlock the hyper inserter and get 5k rocket science as a bonus. Just 9.99 money monthly.
b59f=Just kidding.
b60=Humanities downfall mainly boiled down to them being almost hilariously unable to recognize and address systemic soscietal problems.
b60f=They would rather argue that a large groups of other humans are inherently evil than even consider that there are structural problems that force them to act in a certain way.
b61=Are you done building? Food is ready.
b62=Just so you know. I got nominated for the title of school's sexiest pachin. 2 and a halve times in a row.
b63=I don't understand why you need to clean washing machines. They clean stuff. Why aren't they just inherently clean?
b63f=I mean. You wouldn't wash a piece of soup.
b64=Block broken
b64f=Lava hisses
b65=So... do you like raccoons? They're pretty adorable.
b66=♫ Pack your bags honey, we're going to hell ♪
b66f=Damn I have such a visceral response to this song.
b66ff=(Because it was my wakeup alarm for some months..)
b67=♫ Good means to go punished, my love comes with a price ♩
b67f=♫ All I want is to let you know, I own you ♬
b67ff=♪ Wriggle on as you must, there is no compromise ♫
b67fff=♩ Consuming guilt, you'll walk your path alone ♪
b68=So.. what's your favorite legume?
b69=PogChamp in chat if you see this in a stream.

b1=Tiriscef needs to lose weight.
b1f=Like, badly.
b2=Why don't we have enough hummus? That's bullshit.
b3=Sometimes I dream about moving to a better town.
b4=Don't you have school tomorrow?
b5=God damn biters get off my property!
b6=What's that supposed to be? Spaghetti town?!
b7=AAaarrrh piss, fuck, shit, shit
b7f=stubbed my toe.
b8=It's like confetti, but with biter bodies.
b9=You think you are sooo smart.
b9f=Fool..
b10=It's just a game about building factories. Stop crying!
b11=Ahh yeah. Best platonic sex in my life.
b12=I would prefer to be deaf. *glares at tiriscef*
b13=You amaze me. This factory looks acceptable.
b13f=If you factor in that it was built by a talking goat.
b14=Come with me.
b14f=But go away.
b15=Some economists claim that we have a planned economy here.
b15f=I can't really agree. It doesn't look like you have a plan.

b21=You are driving a train. There are 5 people stuck on the tracks before you. You have two options:\n    1. Do nothing and let the train run over and kill the people on the tracks.\n    2. Stop the train in time and make around 100 people lose their job and possibly their existance under capitalism as they will be late to work.\nSo what do you do?
b21f=Maybe the current real world pandemic is messing with my me. But why is the world more or less stuck with capitalism and market economics? People are like 'it's the best we know and we have no imagination'. Bullshit. Even without a catastrophe it's always at the edge of collapsing and a lot of institutions vital to society hardly find a 'profitable' escuse to exist. Why don't we try out new things?

b23=I wished I was a dodkopus. I could slap so many stupid faces at the same time!
