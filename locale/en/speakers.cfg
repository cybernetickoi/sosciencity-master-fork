Stop the train in time and make around 100 people lose their job and possibly their existance under capitalism as they will be late.\nSo what do you do?
21f=Maybe the current real world pandemic is messing with my me. But why is the world more or less stuck with capitalism? People are like it's the best we know. But even without a catastrophe it's always at the edge of collapsing. Why don't we try out new things?
